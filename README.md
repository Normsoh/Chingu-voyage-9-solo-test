# Chingu-voyage-9-solo-test
This is my first voyage solo test
This is a solo project to prepare me for the task ahead
in the Chingu Voyage 9 cohort.
 I hope to continually build on this effort and I am still
opened to critics, corrections and advice from fellow programmers around the world.
this will help me improve my skill.
My goal is to become a better developer/programmer with or without
libraries or framework.
Also, I am getting a bit familiar with git gradually.
I have learnt that working in a team is the one of the best way to learn.

Thanks Chingu. Thanks to my team member
